ACID properties are the properties which ensure that the database Transactions are processed reliably ensuring the integrity of the data.

- Atomicity means, a transaction should be completed fully or it should not happen at all. If any failure occurs during the transaction, the transaction should be rolled back.
- Consistency means, the data should be consistent across multiple transactions.
- Isolation means, no transactions should interfere with other transactions.
- Durability means, once the transaction is committed the data will be permanent even in case of a failure.
