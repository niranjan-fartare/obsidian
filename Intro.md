Good Afternoon, My name is Niranjan Fartare and I'm a 2023 graduate. I have completed my B.Tech from MIT ADT University, Pune. 

After graduating I got an opportunity to work as a Data Engineer in XYZ org. In my 2 years of working as a Data Engineer I have used tools like, Hive, Hadoop, PySpark, Airflow, Jira, Confluence etc. I have also used various AWS services like, EMR, S3, EC2, RDS, Glue, RedShift, Athena, QuickSight etc.

My current project is Enterprise Credit Card Data Processing in the Finance Domain and my roles and responsibilities were to analyze the delta/daily data and to generate reports based on the business requirements. My responsibilities also included improving exisiting code and unit testing.

In my free time I like to listen to music. Currently I'm looking to explore my skill set and expand my knowledge in the field of data engineering. That's all about me, thank you!
